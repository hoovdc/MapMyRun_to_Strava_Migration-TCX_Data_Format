# MapMyRun to Strava Migration Development Plan

## Project Overview

This development plan outlines a phased approach to migrate fitness data from MapMyRun to Strava using Python automation. The project will extract workout data from MapMyRun, download detailed TCX files, and facilitate bulk upload to Strava.

## Project Clarifications
- I have about 600 workouts to sync.
- I plan to do this only once. In other words, I don't plan to do additional bulk transfers of this data in the future. I'll just use Strava to capture the data in the future.
- I don't want to use the MapMyRun API right now because I believe it would require a delay in my project for human approval of the granting of my API key.
- I am the only user of this project.
- **Strategy Pivot**: The initial plan to use Selenium for UI automation proved too brittle and unreliable due to anti-bot measures on MapMyRun's website. The project has pivoted to a more robust strategy using direct `requests` calls authenticated via a manually extracted session cookie. This bypasses the UI entirely.

## Phase 0: Prerequisites & Setup (2-3 hours)

### Objectives
- Set up development environment
- Obtain necessary credentials and authentication tokens
- Validate access to both platforms

Note: The initial attempt to use public visibility for unauthenticated downloads failed. The subsequent attempt to use Selenium for authenticated downloads also failed due to website complexity. The plan is now updated to use a robust, cookie-based authentication method.

### Tasks
1. **Development Environment Setup**
   - [x] Install Python 3.8+ 
   - [x] Create virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
   - [x] Install required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas requests stravalib python-dotenv beautifulsoup4 tcxreader
     ```
   - [x] Install Chrome browser (if not present, for manual cookie extraction)

2. **Credential Preparation**
   - [x] MapMyRun Credentials: Instead of username/password, use a session cookie.
     - [x] Follow the guide at [docs/how-to-download-tcx.md](docs/how-to-download-tcx.md) to get the required cookie string.
   - [x] Create Strava API application at https://www.strava.com/settings/api
   - [x] Note Client ID, Client Secret from Strava
   - [x] Set Authorization Callback Domain to `localhost`
   - [x] Create `config/.env` file
   - [x] Populate `.env` with credential values:
     ```
     # In config/.env
     MAPMYRUN_COOKIE_STRING='paste_your_full_cookie_string_here'
     STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=your_id
     STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
     ```

   Note: This cookie-based method is far more reliable than UI automation and does not require making workouts public.

3. **Data Export from MapMyRun**
   - [x] Log into MapMyRun web interface
   - [x] Export workout history CSV from https://www.mapmyfitness.com/workout/export/csv
   - [x] Save as `data/From_MapMyRun/CSV_for_event_ID_extraction/mapmyrun_export.csv` in project directory
   - [x] Verify CSV contains workout IDs in Link column

   Note: Making workouts public is no longer a necessary step with the cookie-based authentication approach.

4. **Create Project Structure**
   ```

3. **Activity Enhancement**
   - [x] Set activity names from MapMyRun data, with a sensible fallback for untitled workouts (e.g., "Run on 2023-10-27").
   - [x] Add descriptions/notes.

           # self.inventory = WorkoutInventory(...)
           # self.downloader = MmrDownloader(...)
           # self.uploader = StravaUploader(...)
           
       def run_migration(self):
           # Execute full pipeline:

   ```

2. **CLI Interface**

- Robust error handling
- Performance optimization

### Tasks

   - [ ] Support for other platforms
   - [ ] GUI version

### Deliverables
- Migration verification report
- Archived data
- Enhancement roadmap

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks & Solutions

1. **MapMyRun Changes Website Structure or API**
   - **Risk**: The TCX export URL format (`/workout/export/{id}/tcx`) could change.
   - **Solution**: This is a low risk for a one-time migration. If it changes, the `base_url` in `MmrDownloader` can be easily updated. The core authentication method is more stable than UI elements.

2. **Rate Limiting/IP Blocking**
   - **Solution**: The plan already includes conservative rate limiting (2-3 second delays). We can implement exponential backoff if 429 "Too Many Requests" errors occur. Rotating user agents is also a good practice.

3. **Session Cookie Invalidation**
   - **Risk**: The `auth_token` cookie might expire during a long-running download process.
   - **Solution**: For a one-time migration of ~600 workouts, this is unlikely to be an issue if the script runs quickly. If it fails, the solution is simple: manually grab a new cookie and restart the script. The resume-safe design (using SQLite) ensures no work is lost.

4. **Authentication Failures**
   - **Risk**: The cookie is invalid or expired from the start.
   - **Solution**: The script should perform a test lookup on a known valid workout ID on startup. If it fails, it should exit immediately with a clear error message prompting the user to update their `MAPMYRUN_AUTH_TOKEN` in the `.env` file.

5. **Data Loss**
   - Solution: Always keep originals
   - Implement backups
   - Verification steps

## Success Metrics

- ✓ All workouts successfully migrated
- ✓ No data loss or corruption
- ✓ Execution time under 2 hours for 1000 workouts
- ✓ Less than 1% failure rate
- ✓ User can run with minimal technical knowledge (after the one-time cookie setup)

## Timeline Summary

- **Total Estimated Time**: 30-40 hours
- **Elapsed Time**: 2-3 weeks (working evenings/weekends)
- **Critical Path**: The new critical path is now Phases 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6.
- **Parallel Work**: Phases can be worked on sequentially as the plan is now much more linear and simplified.

## Current Project Status & Next Steps

The project is now feature-complete and architecturally robust. All core phases of the migration plan have been implemented, with a strong focus on data integrity, error handling, and user control.
- An automatic database migration system is in place, ensuring the application is self-healing against schema changes.
- All TCX files have been intelligently validated, accounting for indoor activities.
- The Strava uploader is resilient, handling API errors, duplicates, and missing metadata gracefully.

**The next step is to run the final migration**, which involves executing the full pipeline, monitoring the upload, and verifying the results in Strava. The application is in a production-ready state for its single-user purpose.
